Java Anonymous inner class
Java anonymous inner class is an inner class without a name and for which only a single object is created. An anonymous inner class can be useful when making an instance of an object with certain "extras" such as overloading methods of a class or interface, without having to actually subclass a class.

In simple words, a class that has no name is known as an anonymous inner class in Java.
