/*
Java String intern() Method
A pool of strings, initially empty, is maintained privately by the class String.

When the intern method is invoked, if the pool already contains a String equal to this String object as determined by the equals(Object) method, then the String from the pool is returned. Otherwise, this String object is added to the pool and a reference to this String object is returned.
